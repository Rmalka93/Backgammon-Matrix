
The Rules Of The Game


two players the negative numbers are the blacks stone, and the white player is the possetive numbers

your mission is to take out of the board all your stone

you can eat a stone just if it one stone in the place you want to make a move to

you are not able to move if you have eaten stone

if the cube got double  you have for times to play


hope you'll enjoy
sincerely
